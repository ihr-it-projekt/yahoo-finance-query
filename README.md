## YahooFinanceQuery

A PHP class to query the Yahoo Finance API.

### Features

- search for symbol via Yahoo.Finance.Symbol.AutoSuggest
- query current quotes for symbols
- query historical quotes for single symbol
- query intraday quotes for single symbol
- query basic stock info
- query list of related stocks for index symbols
- query full list of sectors with related industries

### Example

You can find an example.php file under `/example`.

### Installation

require via `composer.json` in your project root
```json
{
    "require": {
        "dirkolbrich/yahoo-finance-query": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

### Implementation

As simple as that:
```php
use DirkOlbrich\YahooFinanceQuery\YahooFinanceQuery;
// [...]
$query = new YahooFinanceQuery;
```

or as static:
```php
use DirkOlbrich\YahooFinanceQuery\YahooFinanceQuery;
// [...]
YahooFinanceQuery->make();
```

### Configuration

YahooFinanceQuery can be configured to return the data as an array or the raw json. Default `returnType` is `array`.

The config setting has to be passed as an array `array('returnType' => 'array')` or  `array('returnType' => 'json')`.

At initialisation:
```php
$query = new YahooFinanceQuery(array('returnType' => 'json'));
```
or as static:
```php
YahooFinanceQuery->make(array('returnType' => 'json'));
```

At run-time:
```php
$query = new YahooFinanceQuery;
$query->config(array('returnType' => 'json'));
```

The current config setting can be retrieved with:
```php
$query->getConfig();
```

To retrieve the raw cURL result use `raw()` as addition to the query. This method must be called before the actural query method.
```php
$query->raw()->quote()->get();
```

To force the query via the YQL api (if possible), use the `yql()` method within the query string. This method must be called before the actural query method. The default is set to not use YQL, as I think YQL querys are unreliable and often with truncated results.
```php
$query->yql()->quote()->get();
```

### Usage

Querys are chainable. Use the `get()` method to to retrieve the results.
```php
$data = $query->method()->get();
```

The following query methods are available:

1. `symbolSuggest($string)`

    Query for symbol suggestion via the YAHOO.Finance.SymbolSuggest.ssCallback
    ```php
    $string = 'basf';
    $data = $query->symbolSuggest($string)->get();
    ```

2. `quote(array $symbol [, array $params])`

    Query for current quote for given symbols and given parameters.

    The passed parameter `$symbol` must be an array. Several symbols can be passed.

    The passed parameter `$params` is optional and must be an array too. It accepts the parameters as a written word or as tags. See as reference the `$quoteParams` variable in the class definition. If `$params` is empty, the query will use all possible params.

    The params 'Symbol', 'LastTradeTime' and 'LastTradeDate' will be quered by default. There will be a unified UTC 'LastTradeTimestamp' added to the result array.

    ```php
    $symbol = array('bas.de');
    $params = array('LastTradePriceOnly', 'x', 'c1');
    $data = $query->quote($symbol, $params)->get();
    ```

3. `historicalQuote(array $symbol [, $startDate, $endDate, $param])`

    Query for historical quotes for given symbol with given start date and end date.

    Only one `$symbol` can be passed per query and must be a string.

    `$startDate` and `$endDate` must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD. If no dates are passed, the query will grab all available historical quotes. If only one date is passed, the other one will be set to the maximum available.

    `$param` is set to default `d` = daily. See `$historicalQuoteParams` variable for other options.

    ```php
    $symbol = array('bas.de');
    $startDate = 2013-07-26;
    $endDate = 2014-01-06;
    $param = 'd';
    $data = $query->historicalQuote($symbol, $startDate, $endDate, $param)->get();
    ```
    I recommend not to use the `yql()` method with historical quotes, as the YQL console permits only up to 365 single result quotes. To retrieve a full set of historical quotes will not be possible via YQL.

4. `intraDay($symbol [, $period, $param])`

    Query finance.yahoo.com for intraday quotes. The symbol must be passed as as string.

    `$period` is optional and default set to `1d`. It is possible to retrieve intraday quotes for up to the last 15 days.

    `$param` is optional and default set to `quote`. For other options see the `$intraDayParams` variable.

    ```php
    $symbol = 'bas.de';
    $period = '5d';
    $data = $query->intraDay($symbol, $period)->get();
    ```

5. `stockInfo($symbol)`

    Query finance.yahoo.com for basic stock information. The symbol must be passed as as string.

    ```php
    $symbol = 'bas.de';
    $data = $query->stockInfo($symbol)->get();
    ```

6. `indexList(array $symbol)`

    Query for an index which returns the symbol and name of the components. Several symbols may be passed as an array.

    See http://finance.yahoo.com/intlindices?e=europe for more symbols to world indices. The caret `^` character must be part of the symbol.

    ```php
    $symbol = array('^GDAXI');
    $data = $query->indexList($symbol)->get();
    ```

7. `sectorList()`

    Query for a complete list of sectors and their corresponding industries.

    This function is static without any params.

    ```php
    $data = $query->sectorList()->get();
    ```

    Which returns an array in this form:

    ```php
    Array (
        [0] => Array (
            [name] => Basic Materials
            [industries] => Array (
                [0] => Array (
                    [name] => Agricultural Chemicals
                    [id] => 112 )
                [1] => Array (
                    [name] => Aluminum
                    [id] => 132 )
                ... )
            )
        [1] => Array (
            [name] => Conglomerates
            [industries] => Array ( ... )
            )
    )
    ```
